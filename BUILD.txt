Welcome to PureBasic OpenSource Projects !

For now, to be able to compile the sources, you will need Windows, as it's the only
supported OS (will change soon). That said, you can try to compile on Linux/OSX
as the makefile contains all needed info to do so.

1. Install UnxUtils
-------------------

You can download it here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/unxutils/

Be sure to add <UnxUtilsInstallPath>\usr\local\wbin in your PATH


2. Install VisualStudio C++ 2013 Community edition
--------------------------------------------------

Some code source are in C and requiers VS to compile. You can also
try with a more recent version, but we use the 2013 version here.


3. Install the Windows Plateform SDK
------------------------------------

We use an old version (7.0) but new version could also work


4. Tune the launch script
-------------------------

To do so, do a copy of Window-x64.cmd or Window-x86.cmd and edit it:
- set PUREBASIC_HOME to a working PureBasic installation
- check all the other path to see if it matches you current system


5. Launch the makefile
----------------------

- Double-click on Window-x64.cmd and go in PureBasicIDE directory
- type: make

If all is setup correctly, it should compile all the dependencies and the IDE
A 'Build' directory will be created with all temporary files in it.

Once you have successfully launched the make once, you can then use
PureBasic to open the "PureBasic IDE.pbp" project file and
run it from PureBasic itself (be sure to adjust the constants in 'Compilers Options.../Contants')
- The #BUILD_DIRECTORY constant must point to the Build/x64/ide/ folder created before by the 'make'
- The #PureBasicPath constant must point to a full PureBasic installation.

Don't hesitate to drop a word to improve this build guide as it's very slim for now !

Have fun hacking,
